# AIMI_PICAI_unet_group16

The Jupyter notebook file demonstrates the steps and calculations involved in selecting the region of interest (ROI) for cropping, ensuring that the prostate is accurately targeted within the input MRI images.

# AIMI-Final-Project

This project is part of the Prostate Imaging Cancer Aritificial Intelligence (PICAI) hosted on [grand-challenge](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/).

This repository builds upon the [provided repository](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_unet_semi_supervised_gc_algorithm) for the inference of models of the challenge. It's there to build containers to be evaluated. To get the original model you can clone this directory:

## Clone the provided repository for inference
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_unet_semi_supervised_gc_algorithm.git
```
In this repository are some additional files that help with working with Snellius.
- replace_path_in_overviews.py: Special thanks to Group 3 that also worked on the PICAI Challenged and shared this code with us.
- trim_model.py: Is there to remove unnecessary information from models that are trained with the baseline code
- Shell scripts: Those include the scripts that we used to train our models using the template algorithm provided by the DIAG-Nijmegen group.
- Juptyter notebook: Demonstrates the steps and calculations involved in selecting the region of interest (ROI) for cropping, ensuring that the prostate is accurately targeted within the input MRI images

To get the [PICAI algorithm baseline](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_baseline/) you can clone it:

## Clone the algorithm template repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_baseline.git
```
